"""The bounded agent loop.

The application owns the loop; the model only fills in the answer. Order of
safeguards, each visible in the trace:

1. Retrieve first. Nothing relevant -> refuse BEFORE spending a model call.
2. One model call with strict JSON instructions; one corrective retry on a
   parse failure; then a flagged refusal. Never an unbounded retry loop.
3. Citations are verified against what was actually retrieved. A citation the
   retriever never returned is a fabrication: stripped, flagged, human review.
