"""Week 2's challenge: your store, and a buyer that refuses well. Scored out of 500.

    from bootcamp_agent.weekly import week2_store   # registers the check
    from bootcamp_agent.bonus import bonus
    bonus("week2-store", {"github": "you", "store": MY_STORE, "buyer": plan_purchase})

IT IS THE FIRST STEP OF THE FINAL PROJECT. The store written here is the one that
goes onto the shared course fork, so the floor is "the deployed program would
accept it". Every store rule is `shipit.storefront.problems`, the ship-it track's
own list, not a second copy of it. The buyer contract is ship-it's
`plan_purchase(holdings, listing, request)`, unchanged.

FIVE TIERS OF 100, AND 100 IS THE FLOOR, exactly like week 1. The floor is both
parts working once: a store that could exist, and a buyer that buys from it and
refuses one raw unit short with a sentence naming both amounts and the mint.
Everything above it is a case a toy buyer gets wrong.

WHERE THE SCORE GOES. It lives in `bonus.BONUS`, not `checks.CHECKS`, so session
10's two exercises stay two exercises. The `week 2 challenge: S/500` line below is
added to the ch10 row by the track, read from the saved session notebook (see
`bootcamp_agent.weekly`). That line is a contract; do not reword it.

NOTHING HERE REACHES A NETWORK, A KEY OR A WALLET. The listings below are data.
