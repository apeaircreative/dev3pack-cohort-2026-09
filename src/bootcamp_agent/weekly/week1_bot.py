"""Week 1's challenge: a bot that refuses well, scored out of 500.

    from bootcamp_agent.weekly import week1_bot   # registers the check
    from bootcamp_agent.bonus import bonus
    bonus("week1-bot", respond)

FIVE TIERS OF 100, AND 100 IS THE FLOOR. The floor is "the four exits work and a
person can see which one they got". Everything above it is a thing a real bot
needs and a toy does not: a tool of your own that can refuse, the receipt visible
to the reader, the budget that recovers, and your own loop from `ch05-e2` behind
it. A learner who stops at 100 has finished the week; the other 400 is where the
bot becomes theirs.

WHY IT IS STILL UNCOUNTED. It lives in `bonus.BONUS`, which no session total
reads, so the 200 marks of session 5 stay the 200 marks of session 5. The score
below is the challenge's own, reported to the learner and to whoever reviews it.

WHAT IT JUDGES. One function:

    respond(text: str, chat: dict) -> dict     # {"stopped_because", "reply", ...}

It never asks where the messages came from. Telegram, a terminal, a web form or a
test are all the same to it, and requiring a bot token would price the challenge
behind an account.

#: The questions asked when a bot does not say what it answers. Deliberately
#: about this course, because that is the one subject every learner's bot could
#: plausibly share -- but a bot about expenses, or reviews, or anything else says
#: so instead:

#:     respond.examples = ["how much for meals", "convert 900 BRL to EUR"]
#:     respond.broken = "/page does-not-exist"

#: WHY IT IS ASKED RATHER THAN GUESSED. The first version of this check hardcoded
#: course questions and then judged an expenses bot for not knowing them: it
#: scored 0 for answering exactly as designed. A check that assumes the domain
#: judges the wrong thing.
