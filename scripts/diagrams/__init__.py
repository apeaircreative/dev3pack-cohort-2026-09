"""Every course diagram, drawn in one style: a panel per idea, icons, labelled arrows.

    uv run --extra projects python scripts/diagrams

Each diagram is our own drawing of the course's own parts. Re-run after changing
a number the pictures quote; the numbers are written next to where they came from.

One drawing, two renderings: the course pages are light, the decks are dark.
`theme` owns the palette and decides where a rendering may land, `canvas`,
`terminal` and `slide` are the three ways of drawing, and every other module is
one session's figures. Everything a caller used when this was a single file is
re-exported here, so `import diagrams` still reaches all of it.
